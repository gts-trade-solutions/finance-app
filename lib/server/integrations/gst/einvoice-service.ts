// Registering an invoice, end to end.
//
// Five steps, in this order, and the order is the design:
//
//   1. load the invoice as the portal's schema wants to see it
//   2. check it ourselves, and refuse in our own words if it is wrong
//   3. build the document
//   4. call whichever provider this branch is connected to
//   5. store what came back, inside the caller's transaction
//
// Step 2 is why an attempt is not wasted on a document that could never be
// accepted. Step 5 is inside the transaction because an IRN that the portal
// issued and the books did not record is the worst state this can end in:
// the invoice is legally registered, cannot be registered again, and nothing
// in the app knows. The call log is written outside the transaction for the
// same reason — see `runPortalCall`.
