// The stand-in portal.
//
// This is not scaffolding to be deleted later. It is the provider the demo
// book uses permanently, and it has to keep working with no network, no
// credentials and no encryption key — a fully worked example that somebody can
// click through without signing up is the point of the demo, and it cannot
// depend on a government service being up.
//
// So it behaves like the portal in the ways that matter to the code around it:
// the reference numbers it issues are derived from the document exactly as the
// real ones are, which makes them stable across retries and unique per
// document. It differs in the one way that matters to a human: everything it
// produces is visibly marked, so no screen, print or export can pass a
// pretend registration off as a real one.
